Today I'm announcing **960Gen**, a web application designed to bring the excitement of Fischer Random Chess to chess enthusiasts everywhere. By generating unique board states and enabling users to save their favorite configurations, my hope is to make it easier than ever before for people to dive into the world of Chess960.


## Why Fischer Random Chess?

Fischer Random Chess, also known as Chess960, is a chess variant where the starting positions of the pieces are randomized within certain constraints, resulting in 960 unique potential starting configurations. This allows for fun, new, and exciting games and scenarios that would likely never happen in a standard chess match. 960Generation has a goal of providing a platform for chess players to delve into these one-of-a-kind board states and share their discoveries with others.


## Features

- Generate random Fischer Random Chess board states with a simple click

- Set up a user profile to save favorite board states


## Technical Overview

The while of this application will rely on technologies comprising three key areas:

**Frontend:** The user interface will be built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, with React.

**Backend:** Node.js and Express will be used to create a server capable of handling user authentication, board generation, and data storage.

**Database:** User profiles and saved boards will be stored using MongoDB.


I look forward to deployment!
